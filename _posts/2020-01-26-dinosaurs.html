<p>Hey there,<br>

Do you want to have a goal 5k to train for? Or do you want to run for a good cause?
  Maybe, you just want to spend a nice Sunday morning walking a mile surrounded by friends, music, and food. 
  Perhaps you want to see if you can win one of our great prizes, either from our 10+ mini carnival games, Tug-of-War battle, or by being a top finisher. 
  All of those requests can be fulfilled by attending the first-ever Legwork for Lungs 5k and Mile Walk.<br>
  
  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Center, the organization this event is benefiting, has been fighting cancer for years. To learn more about it, click on the MSK Approval Page tab on the left, and scroll down to the about section.
  I hope to see you at the starting line on Sunday, November 9.
  I hope you can take the time to look around this website to learn more about lung cancer and why this 5k is being held.
