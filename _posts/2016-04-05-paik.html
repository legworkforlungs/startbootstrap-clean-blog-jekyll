<p>I met up with Dr. Paik in his office on the Upper East Side in New York City with his two assistants. 
  It was great to finally meet the person who has been using our community’s donation to help develop potential new treatments, and I was overall amazed at how he was able to describe complex concepts in an understandable and engaging way.
  At some parts during the interview, my contact with MSK, Colleen Hanley, and my mom, Valentina, couldn’t help but chime in with their own questions. I hope you find the below transcript informative and interesting as we continue doing the legwork necessary to help advocate for research on this dangerous disease. 
  I’d like to give an additional thank you to Colleen for helping organize our meeting and later editing!</p>
