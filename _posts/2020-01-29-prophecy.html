<p>I met up with Dr. Paik in his office on the Upper East Side in New York City with his two assistants. 
  It was great to finally meet the person who has been using our community’s donation to help develop potential new treatments, and I was overall amazed at how he was able to describe complex concepts in an understandable and engaging way.
  At some parts during the interview, my contact with MSK, Colleen Hanley, and my mom, Valentina, couldn’t help but chime in with their own questions. I hope you find the below transcript informative and interesting as we continue doing the legwork necessary to help advocate for research on this dangerous disease. 
  I’d like to give an additional thank you to Colleen for helping organize our meeting and later editing!**-Nastassja</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">Hi, I’m Paul Paik and I’m an assistant attending with Thoracic Oncology Services here at Memorial Sloan Kettering.</blockquote>

<p>Over the past two years, Legwork for Lungs has donated more than $8,000 to lung cancer research, along with a combination of federal grants, other fundraisers, and donations of everyday people that been funneled into cancer research. 
  What is the impact of these contributions and how do you allocate these funds?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">That’s a good question - I think the most important thing to note is the following statistic. Over the past, let’s say at least 10 and approaching 15 years, federal funding for cancer research has been essentially flat - adjusting for inflation - which is a big problem because the pace of research has quickened. The number of new discoveries has accelerated, and I think the other thing is the degree to which we have to rely on our colleagues who research other cancers has increased. 
  What we’ve discovered is that there are some essentially basic mechanisms that someone who’s doing melanoma research may discovered that we’re not going to know about, but this is something that’s also applicable to lung cancer, and it’s something we would not have otherwise understood.<br><br>
  
  The reason I mention this is because of the role of foundation funding and the role of individual contributions as a result really has become more important as time passes. We’ve used your particular donation already actually. 
  It was used for a series of in-house experiments to try to figure out why a patient in particular had a very good response to this targeted therapy, and the contribution was used to figure out what the mechanisms of that were. And so when we get these donations, they have real and immediate use in terms of the research that we’re doing.

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
