  We’d like to wish our good friend and Legwork for Lungs' Forrest Gump Andrei Volkov good luck at the NYC Marathon November 1st (this Sunday). This is his 11th marathon - he’s already competed in marathons across the World, including Berlin (Germany), Philadelphia, Boston, Athens (Greece), Jerusalem (Israel), Chicago, China (Great Wall), Pocono, Medoc (France), Stockholm (Sweden).
</p>

<p>
  He’s also participated in several trail ultramarathons and countless 1/2 marathons, Mud Runs, 15K, 10K, and 5K all over America, Europe, and Asia. He trains in any weather on US forest trails, surviving several encounters with local wildlife unscathed.
</p>

<p>
  If you’d like to meet and talk with this incredible individual, please attend the second-annual Legwork for Lungs 5k & Mile Walk!
</p>
