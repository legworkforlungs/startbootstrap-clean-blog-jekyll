<p>When I made the decision to carry on Legwork for Lungs, the first priority on my list was redesigning the website. 
After the original website, a second version was developed by Ramesh Balaji and later maintained by Ryan Lee, which we used for our 2024 5K Run and Mile Walk. 
However, as we approached our next 5K, I still saw improvements to be made. That's why I learned how to use GitHub to code an entirely new website.</p>


<h4>Why Redesign?</h4>

<p>Our old site served us well for 8 years. And while it has meaningful memories, I wanted something cleaner, faster, and easier to navigate.
  Although some parts of the old website have been changed, I made sure to preserve the history and purpose of Legwork for Lungs. You can read the old blog posts, posted by our founder, Nastassja Kuznetsova!</p>

<p>I hope everyone enjoys this new website :)</p>
