<p>Thank you everyone (and by everyone we mean all runners, walkers, volunteers, sponsors, and donors) for contributing to the Legwork for Lungs event! Hopefully, our efforts will be rewarded and the sum of our efforts creates an impact.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that the 2015 Legwork for Lungs Team raised a total of $5,474 for Dr. Paik’s lung cancer research at MSKCC. And, of course, let’s not limit your support to 2015 - make sure to join us next year at our now third annual run.</p>
<p>Nastassja Kuznetsova,<br><br>Race Director</p>
