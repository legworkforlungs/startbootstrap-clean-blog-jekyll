<p>
This last academic semester (2024-2025) marked a new chapter for Legwork for Lungs (LFL) at Rutgers University!
</p>
<h2>Officially Recognized!</h2>
<p>After LFL's three-year hiatus, we became officially recognized at Rutgers University in the Spring 2024 semester! 
  Excited to expand the mission of LFL, we dedicated our time at Rutgers to hosting larger events to spread lung cancer awareness
  while creating meaningful service opportunities for students.</p>

<h2>Community Engagement and Impact</h2>
<p>LFL has hosted a series of community service events throughout the semester!</p>

<h4>Race-Day Posters</h4>
<p>Each year, we create and design race-day posters for our 5K race. Volunteers hold up these signs throughout the course to 
  cheer runners on and to help them stay on course during the race!</p>

<h4>Runner Goodie-Bags</h4>
<p>Each runner receives a runner's goodie-bag filled with their t-shirt, runner's bib, and other complimentary goods.
Our volunteers help us pack these items before race day!</p>

<h4>Christmas Stocking Stuffing</h4>
<p>Last Christmas (2024), we created Christmas stockings and DIY snowglobes to donate to Crossroads4Hope, a cancer support community center!</p>

<h4>Scarlet Funds Valentines</h4>
<p>For Valentine's day (2025), our volunteers helped us make over sixty Valentines for pediatric cancer patients and healthcare workers <3</p>

<h4>Patient Care Packaging</h4>
<p>At our last event of the year, we made fifty patient care packages, providing cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with hygiene essentials!</p>

<h2>Our 8th Annual 5K Run and Mile Walk</h2>
<p>LFL hosted their first 5K run and mile walk event since 2021. Despite some challenges, we did our best to make this event as successful and 
meaningful as possible. Through this event, we raised over $2500.00 to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center!</p>
