<p>The Legwork for Lungs Club is a group of worldwide individuals committed to increasing lung cancer support and awareness through the organization of grassroots events in our community.

We're not a multibillion-dollar organization; in fact, most of our members and all of our leadership are comprised of students. This has not stopped us, however, from raising $30,000+ for Dr. Paik's lung cancer research at MSKCC. This year's goal is another $3,000, which would bring our total to $33,000 over the past nine years. To read our interview with Dr. Paik, the benefactor of our funds, please click here. You can also find out more about why our founder, Nastassja Kuznetsova, started Legwork for Lungs here, and how we got started here .

While we're based and founded out of Ridge High School in Basking Ridge, NJ, we have connected individuals across the world to support our cause. Please join us on November 1st on International Legwork for Lungs Day! You can do this by taking a picture of you wearing a Legwork for Lungs T-shirt or simply something white (the color that signifies lung cancer) with an orange ribbon. Make sure to include your location, and we'll be sure to post all of our supporters on Facebook and online. Don't forget, November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month!</p>
