<p>Legwork for Lungs is a student-led initiative committed to raising awareness and funding for lung cancer research. We organize annual 5K runs and community events to support groundbreaking research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).
</p>

<p>Legwork for Lungs began as a high school initiative at Ridge High School in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, 
  founded by Nastassja Kuznetsova and students passionate about making a difference in the fight against lung cancer. 
  What started as a local 5K fundraiser quickly grew into a movementâ€”uniting students, families, and community members around a shared mission: to end lung cancer.</p>
<p>Now based at Rutgers University, Legwork for Lungs continues to grow, creating countless service opportunities for students to get involved.
</p>
<p>At our core, we believe that every step counts. Whether you're running for a loved one, walking for awareness, or volunteering your time, you're helping us make real progress in the race to end lung cancer.</p>
